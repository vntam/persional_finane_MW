# AI Chatbot Module (WIP)

This directory will house the upcoming AI chatbot feature. Suggested layout:

- `services/` for providers and orchestration logic.
- `routes/` for Express adapters that expose chatbot endpoints.
- `clients/` for SDK wrappers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
- `tests/` mirroring the structure above.

Implementation intentionally deferred. Create design docs and interface contracts here before coding to keep the feature scoped and reviewable.
