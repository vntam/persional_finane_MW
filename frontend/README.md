# Frontend Structure

- `src/features/*`: Feature-first folders for auth, dashboard, transactions, AI insights, and settings.
- `src/routes`: Central routing table so FE engineer can plug new screens quickly.
- `src/layouts`: Shared layouts (dashboard shell, auth shell, etc.).
- `src/lib`: API clients, hooks, and util layers.
- `src/components/ui`: Reusable primitives that keep styling consistent.
